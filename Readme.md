##Not so much a real-world application
IoTheMan is a web-application that tracks bills that you owe: who you owe, how much, when they're due, and information about paying them.

It's real-world applicability is limited given there are dozens of existing ways to manage your bills.

##What it is good for
IoTheMan is a learning project. It's a problem at which I can throw new languages, database systems, frameworks, tools and techniques to help learn them. It's more than a Kata, but less than a releasable product. It's a chance to plant greenfield more often than the day job allows.

The general process goes something like this.

- Build a simple but functional application mostly with languages and frameworks I know, but substituting one or two pieces of the stack with something new that I want to learn.
- In subsequent iterations, add features using new tools, techniques and frameworks, swapping out existing pieces as necessary.
- Repeat as desired, starting from scratch when necessary.

##Roadmap
###First iteration
Learn some MongoDB and improve TDD skills while building a basic CRUD app.

###Second iteration
Brush up on CSS, responsive design and learn some Angular.js by building a front-end application.

###Third iteration
Rewrite in ASP.Net vNext.

###Subsequent iterations
Rewrite with non-.Net languages/frameworks and different front-end frameworks.
